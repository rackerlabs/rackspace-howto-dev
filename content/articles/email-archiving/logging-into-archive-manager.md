Alternatively, you can log in through the Cloud Office Control Panel by
performing the following steps:

1.  Log in to the [Cloud Office Control
    Panel](https://cp.rackspace.com).
2.  Open the **Go to section** menu and select **Domains**.  \
     \

    ![](/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/Logging%20in%20to%20Archiving%20Manager%201a.png)\
      
3.  In the **Manage** section, click **Email Archiving**.\
     \

    ![](/knowledge_center/sites/default/files/field/image/Logging%20in%20to%20Archiving%20Manager%202a.png)\
     **Note**:  If you have multiple domains, select the appropriate
    domain name. To change domains at any time, click the **Change
    domain** option at the top of the page. \
      
4.  Click **Manage My Archive**.\
