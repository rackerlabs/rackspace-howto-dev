### What Happens to Old Images?

In order to provide the best experience possible for our customers we
carefully maintain the list of images displayed when building a new
cloud server. This means that from time to time older versions of an
operating system may be removed from the default list, usually shortly
after a newer version is released. In general, we try to keep the most
current and at least one previous release of each operating system we
support.

Images that have been publicly released are never actually deleted, so
you can still access these older images by referencing the image ID
directly through the Cloud Servers API.  If yo&rsquo;re looking for an older
version of your favorite Linux distro you can probably locate it in the
list below. Please be aware that these older images are no longer
maintained and may not contain the most up-to-date patches and package
updates.
